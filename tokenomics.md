# Tokenomics

**Token Name:** ElipeToken (ET)&#x20;

**Token Type:** ElipeToken is an BEP-20 token built on the BSC blockchain. This choice provides compatibility with the BSC ecosystem and allows for easy integration with existing wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications (DApps).

**Total Supply**: The total supply of ElipeToken is fixed at 200 million tokens. This finite supply ensures scarcity, which can potentially drive value over time.

**Token Distribution:**

* Initial Coin Offering (ICO): 40% of the total token supply is allocated for the ICO phase. This allows for initial fundraising to support development, marketing, and other project expenses.&#x20;
* Team and Advisors: 20% of the total token supply is allocated to the project's development team and advisors. This incentivizes the team to work towards the long-term success of the project.&#x20;
* Reserve: 15% of the total token supply is reserved for future development, community initiatives, partnerships, and liquidity provision.
* Ecosystem Fund: 15% of the total token supply is dedicated to building and nurturing the ElipeToken ecosystem. This fund may be used for incentivizing developers, funding DApps, organizing community events, and fostering adoption
* Marketing and Partnerships: 10% of the total token supply is allocated to marketing activities, partnerships with other projects, and initiatives aimed at increasing awareness and adoption of ElipeToken

**Token Utility:**



* Payment: ElipeToken can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services within the ElipeToken ecosystem and potentially beyond
* Governance: ElipeToken holders may have governance rights, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes such as protocol upgrades, fund allocation, and parameter adjustments
* Staking: ElipeToken holders can stake their tokens to help secure the network, validate transactions, and earn rewards in the form of additional ElipeToken.
* Access: Holding a certain amount of ElipeToken may grant access to exclusive features, products, or services within the ecosystem
